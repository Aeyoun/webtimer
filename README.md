## Web Timer

Get the [Web Timer extension](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/web-timer/) from Opera’s extension catalog.

Web Timer is an Opera port of a Google Chrome extension designed to help you keep track of how you’re using your time online. Nice charts powered by the Google Visualization/Charts API.

You get insight into how you use the web, how focused you are, and which sites are your biggest time wasters.

Run `make` to package it as an Opera extension and open the resulting _webtimer.oex_ file with Opera. Or drag the _config.xml_ file on top of an Opera window to install it in developer mode.
