## Web Timer

Web Timer is an Opera port of a Google Chrome extension designed to help you keep track of how you’re using your time online. Nice charts powered by the Google Visualization/Charts API.

Run `make` to package it as an Opera extension and open the resulting _webtimer.oex_ file with Opera. Or drag the _config.xml_ file on top of an Opera window to install it in developer mode.
